excerpt: As is known to all react users, useEffect hook will be called after render. Let's get into React to learn how it is realized.

[`useEffect`](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useEffect) is a frequently used hook for all react users.
As is mentioned in this [doc](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/synchronizing-with-effects),
effects let you run some code _after rendering_ so that you can synchronize your component with some system outside of React.
Maybe you are as curious as I am about how React controls the timing to call useEffect.
In this article, we will focus on how it is realized.

# TL; DR

Your browser will do Style calculations, Layout, Paint and Compositing after javascript task.
So in the next task of Javascript, the change of previous task are rendered.
`useEffect` use MessageChannel API to call the effect function in the next javascript task.

# The browser's rendering pipeline

Imagining changing the width of a div in your site using javascript, the browser won't immediately commit it to render.
(The rendering pipeline is very complicated, we just focus on the process and don't need to go deep.)

1. The browser will first run all synchronous javascript after your change-width code;
2. Calculate styles caused by the change;
3. Layout the elements on the screen by the final styles;
4. Paint visual parts of the elements;
5. Compositing layers and then you can see final web on screen.

In the next javascript task, the render process caused by changing width is done and you can get the offsetWidth of the div performance friendly.

Maybe you will ask: what if I get offsetWidth right after changing width? Will I get the width before changing it?

Definitely not. The browser guarantees you can get the right width by invoke a immediate layout.
What you should keep in mind is that it is costly to layout and paint and you should call it as less as you can.

The rendering process can be visible in chrome performance devtool.

Just open a web page, open the Chrome Devtools and Switch to Performance tab.
Then click recording and run the below code in devtools console.
Finally stop recording, Chrome will show you the timeline of render process.

```js
const div = document.getElementById('your-div');
div.style.width = '200px';
```
You will see timeline like that. The render process is the same as we talked before.

Change the code to below and run it again by the same steps.

```js
const div = document.getElementById('your-div');
div.style.width = '300px';
console.log(div.offsetWidth); // 200
```

This time things become different. Recalculate Style and Layout are in the same task as Javascript.
So that the console log width is the final width of div.

# How does useEffect run after render

The secret of React is in [Scheduler.js](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/HEAD/packages/scheduler/src/forks/Scheduler.js#L599-L630).

```js
// Copied from react repo.
let schedulePerformWorkUntilDeadline;
if (typeof localSetImmediate === 'function') {
  // Node.js and old IE.
  // There's a few reasons for why we prefer setImmediate.
  //
  // Unlike MessageChannel, it doesn't prevent a Node.js process from exiting.
  // (Even though this is a DOM fork of the Scheduler, you could get here
  // with a mix of Node.js 15+, which has a MessageChannel, and jsdom.)
  // https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20756
  //
  // But also, it runs earlier which is the semantic we want.
  // If other browsers ever implement it, it's better to use it.
  // Although both of these would be inferior to native scheduling.
  schedulePerformWorkUntilDeadline = () => {
    localSetImmediate(performWorkUntilDeadline);
  };
} else if (typeof MessageChannel !== 'undefined') {
  // DOM and Worker environments.
  // We prefer MessageChannel because of the 4ms setTimeout clamping.
  const channel = new MessageChannel();
  const port = channel.port2;
  channel.port1.onmessage = performWorkUntilDeadline;
  schedulePerformWorkUntilDeadline = () => {
    port.postMessage(null);
  };
} else {
  // We should only fallback here in non-browser environments.
  schedulePerformWorkUntilDeadline = () => {
    localSetTimeout(performWorkUntilDeadline, 0);
  };
}
```

`useEffect` use MessageChannel API to run effect function at next javascript task.
When `useEffect` is called, React will send a message to MessageChannel and the listener will be called at the next javascript task.
At this time, all the style change of previous task are committed and you can get dom properties performance friendly.

Let's look it in Performance devtool.

```js
const div = document.getElementById('div');
div.style.width = '400px';
const mc = new MessageChannel();
mc.port1.onmessage = () => console.log(div.offsetWidth);
mc.port2.postMessage(null);
```

The first task is Javascript, following by Layout task (Recalculate Style, Layout, Paint and Compositing). MessageChannel listener is called at the final task.
We attempt to get div's offsetWidth after Layout task without invoking a immediate Layout.

When I write this post, I find things maybe a little different if your task is too small.
Browser doesn't run Layout task before MessageChannel listener.
But anyway, MessageChannel is not the same task as previous Javascript task. 
All changes in the previous Javascript task are committed before Layout.
